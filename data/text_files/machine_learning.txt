 
Machine learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) where systems learn from data to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It involves gathering and preparing data, choosing appropriate algorithms, training a model to learn patterns, and evaluating its performance on new, unseen data to ensure it generalizes well. The primary goal is to build models that can apply learned patterns to real-world tasks, a process called inference. 
Key Concepts
Artificial Intelligence (AI): A broad field of AI that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
Algorithms: The set of rules or procedures that a machine learning model follows to learn from data. 
Data: The raw information (examples or experiences) that machine learning models learn from to identify patterns and make predictions. 
Model Training: The process of feeding data into an algorithm to learn patterns and adjust parameters to optimize performance on the training data. 
Generalization: The ability of a trained model to perform well on new, unseen data by applying the patterns learned from the training set to real-world scenarios. 
Core Components of the Machine Learning Process
Data Collection: Gathering relevant and sufficient data to be used for training the model. 
Data Preparation: Cleaning, structuring, and transforming the raw data into a format that is suitable for the machine learning algorithm. 
Algorithm Selection: Choosing the right type of algorithm (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement) that is best suited for the problem at hand. 
Model Training: Training the selected algorithm on the prepared data to help it learn patterns and relationships. 
Model Evaluation: Testing the trained model's performance on new, unseen data to assess its accuracy and ability to generalize. 
Inference (Deployment): Using the finalized and well-performing model to make predictions or decisions on real-world data. 
Types of Machine Learning
Supervised Learning: Models are trained on labeled data (input-output pairs) to predict or classify new data. 
Unsupervised Learning: Models discover hidden patterns, structures, and clusters in unlabeled data without predefined output. 
Reinforcement Learning: Models learn by trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for their actions to maximize performance in decision-making tasks.
