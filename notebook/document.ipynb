The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been ﬁrmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29, 2, 5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [31, 21, 13].\\n∗Equal contribution. Listing order is random.

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The ﬁrst is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\n2'),\n",

That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and ﬁxed [8].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\n6'),\n",

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'),\n",

Europe \\nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong \\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable \\nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is \\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market \\ndynamics of each geographic region.\\nMarkets and Distribution\\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government \\nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers \\nthrough its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution \\nchannels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company’s net \\nsales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales.\\nCompetition\\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price \\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.

The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal \\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \\nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \\nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \\nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \\nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \\nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \\nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \\nas competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s \\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \\nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \\nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of \\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, \\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual \\nproperty rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual \\nproperty rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, \\nthe Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \\ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \\nCompany has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single \\nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the \\nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include \\nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various \\naspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such \\nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future \\non reasonable terms or at all.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3'),\n",

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nHuman Capital\\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive \\nenvironment for all of its team members. As of September\\xa0 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time \\nequivalent employees.\\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of \\nharassment or discrimination.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the \\nCompany’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their \\nneeds and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide \\nvariety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ \\nindividual growth and development.\\nInclusion and Diversity\\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities \\nit serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and \\nsupport equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\\nEngagement\\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an \\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to \\ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee \\nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\\nHealth and Safety\\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace \\nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security \\nand crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard \\nenvironments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers \\nthrough its global security team.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and \\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \\n“Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, \\ntechnology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to \\noffer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures \\napply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply \\nchain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, \\nrestructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s \\noperations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and \\ndisruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company \\nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, \\nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company’s business. If \\ndisputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and \\nrestrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other \\ninternational disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the \\nCompany’s business.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract \\nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters.

Global climate \\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more \\nfrequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and \\ndeliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result \\nin slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in \\naffected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience \\nsignificant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited \\nsources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would \\nexacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While \\nthe Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur \\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. \\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the \\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; \\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight \\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales \\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays \\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to \\ncover all losses that may arise.\\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological \\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price \\ncompetition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short \\nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid \\nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative \\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace.

The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, \\nincluding timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new \\ntechnologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective \\nmanagement of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products \\nin appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may \\nhave quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future \\nintroductions and transitions of products and services.\\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing \\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in \\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is \\ncurrently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations.

In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be \\ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial \\ndisputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade \\ndisputes.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, \\nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements \\nhelp ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial \\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of \\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on \\ncommercially reasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant \\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to \\nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s \\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past \\nexperienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities \\nof components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the \\nCompany has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able \\nto extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, \\nwhich can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s \\nability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional \\neconomic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’s operations and performance depend \\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the \\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition,” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain \\ncomponents. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can \\nmaterially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product \\nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing \\ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any \\nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components \\ncustomized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has \\nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the \\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints \\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business \\nand financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient \\nquantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could \\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing \\ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues \\nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist \\nin components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s \\nproducts unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the \\nCompany’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings \\ncan have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors.

Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that \\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be \\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign \\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing \\ndemand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to \\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross \\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign \\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its \\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may \\nincrease the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by \\noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In \\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory \\ncomponents. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term \\nsupply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has \\nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term \\nprepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to \\nadditional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a \\nnumber of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income \\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for \\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the \\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings \\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of \\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant \\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service \\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome \\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the \\noutcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the \\nCompany’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of \\noperations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, \\nthe Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price \\nand volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating \\nperformance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to \\nexceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future \\ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will \\ncontinue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are \\nsubject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it \\nto acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, \\ndividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which \\ncould have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\\nItem 1B. \\nUnresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C. \\nCybersecurity\\nNot applicable.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 16'),\n",

(“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) \\nagainst the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the \\nCompany’s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to \\nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store \\nReview Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting \\ndevelopers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app \\npurchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. \\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and \\nEpic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied \\nboth petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to \\nthe U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S. Supreme Court denies Apple’s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire.\\nMasimo\\nMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade \\nCommission (the “ITC”) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen \\nfeature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to \\nthe United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC \\nentered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with \\nblood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the \\nend of the administrative review period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to \\nappeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \\nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in \\nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is \\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above \\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially \\nadversely affected.\\nItem 4. \\nMine Safety Disclosures\\nNot applicable.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 17'),\n",

The Company uses various strategies \\nto manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio \\nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase \\nthe interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative \\ninstruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any \\nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\\xa030, 2023 and \\nSeptember\\xa024, 2022 (dollars in millions):\\nInterest Rate\\nSensitive Instrument\\nHypothetical Interest\\nRate Increase\\nPotential Impact\\n2023\\n2022\\nInvestment portfolio\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nDecline in fair value\\n$ \\n3,089 \\n$ \\n4,022 \\nTerm debt\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nIncrease in annual interest expense\\n$ \\n194 \\n$ \\n201 \\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other \\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the \\nCompany’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair \\nvalues of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use \\nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company \\nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or \\nprohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of \\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair \\nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. \\nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 \\nmillion and $1.0 billion as of September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022, respectively.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the \\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s \\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over \\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer \\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). \\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \\nestablished that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, \\nMac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated \\nsales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to \\nreceive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the \\nright to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with \\neach device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative \\nSSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is \\nbased on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized \\nwhen control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the \\nproduct-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis \\nover the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the \\nCompany for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated \\nthe application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of \\n€1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the \\nEuropean Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, \\n2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a \\nhearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024.

The Company’s \\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\\xa0\\n(i)\\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the Company’s assets;\\n(ii)\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in \\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\\n(iii)\\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s \\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can \\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a \\ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative \\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute \\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of \\ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in \\nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting \\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the \\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework \\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s \\nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September\\xa030, 2023 \\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in \\naccordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit \\nreport on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023, which were \\nidentified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the \\nExchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over \\nfinancial reporting.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 52'),\n",

We introduced our first Tensor Core GPU in 2017, built from the ground-up for the new era of AI, and our first autonomous\\ndriving system-on-chips, or SoC, in 2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to include networking, enabled our platforms to\\nbe data center scale, and led to the introduction of a new processor class – the data processing unit, or DPU. Over the past 5 years, we have built full software\\nstacks that run on top of our GPUs and CUDA to bring AI to the world’s largest industries, including NVIDIA DRIVE stack for autonomous driving, Clara for\\nhealthcare, and Omniverse for industrial digitalization; and introduced the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software – essentially an operating system for enterprise AI\\napplications. In 2023, we introduced our first data center CPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high performance computing, or HPC. With a strong\\nengineering culture, we drive fast, yet harmonized, product and technology innovations in all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, networking,\\nsoftware and algorithms. More than half of our engineers work on software.\\nThe world’s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our data center-scale accelerated computing platforms to enable,\\naccelerate, develop, or enrich the services and offerings they deliver to billions of end users, including AI solutions and assistants, AI foundation models, search,\\nrecommendations, social networking, online shopping, live video, and translation.\\nEnterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our accelerated computing platforms to build new generative and agentic AI-enabled products\\nand services, and/or to dramatically accelerate and reduce the costs of their workloads and workflows. The enterprise software industry uses them for new AI\\nassistants, chatbots, and agents; the transportation industry for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry for accelerated and computer-aided drug discovery;\\nand the financial services industry for customer support and fraud detection.\\n4\"),\n",

We utilize foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor\\nManufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from\\nSK Hynix Inc., Micron Technology, Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with independent subcontractors\\nand contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our\\nfinal products.\\nCompetition\\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the\\nprincipal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software\\nsupport, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain\\ncompetitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to\\ndeliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing\\ncompetitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by\\nour products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, embedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI\\ncomputing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel,\\nand proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be\\nmore able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\\nOur current competitors include:\\n•\\nsuppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other accelerated computing solutions, including\\nsolutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\\n•\\nlarge cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated or AI computing functionality as part\\nof their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Inc., or Amazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and Microsoft Corporation,\\nor Microsoft;\\n•\\nsuppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as\\nAmazon, Huawei, and Microsoft;\\n•\\nsuppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming\\ndevices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung,\\nor companies with internal teams designing SoC products for their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\\n•\\nnetworking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including optical modules) include such as AMD,\\nArista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and Marvell\\nTechnology, Inc. as well as internal teams of system vendors and large cloud services companies.\\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to\\nprotect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous\\npatents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our\\nproducts and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The\\nlaws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or\\nIP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more\\nlikely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\\n•\\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\\n9'),\n",

The licensing\\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent\\nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for\\nshipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL\\n72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and\\nCountry Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand\\nthat partners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified,\\nimpose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or\\ncorresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs,\\n(including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include\\nfuture NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance\\nand/or performance density.\\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet\\nthe characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long\\nterm, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has\\nchanged and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing\\nrequirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and\\nmay be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as\\nother impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose\\nrestrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our\\nability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export\\ncontrols or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.

Fiscal year 2025 metrics are expected to be published in the first\\nhalf of fiscal year 2026. There has been no material impact to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global\\nenvironmental sustainability regulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. We committed to purchase or generate enough renewable\\nenergy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for offices and data centers under our operational control starting with our fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year\\n2024, we made progress towards this goal and increased the percentage of our electricity use matched by renewable energy to 76%. By the end of fiscal year\\n2026, we also aim to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA’s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions with the goal of effecting supplier\\nadoption of science-based targets.\\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is\\nimportant in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-accelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for\\nmany workloads because it is optimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. We continue to have a strong presence on the\\nGreen500 list of the most energy-efficient systems—we powered 8 of the top 10 most energy efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the\\nNovember 2024 Green500 list.\\nWe launched our Earth-2 initiative to create a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will enable scientists, companies,\\nand policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\\nHuman Capital Management\\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year\\n2025, we had approximately 36,000 employees in 38 countries; 27,100 were engaged in research and development and 8,900 were engaged in sales,\\nmarketing, operations, and administrative positions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies\\nrelating to human capital management.\\nTo execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent globally, including exceptional executives, scientists,\\nengineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\\nRecruitment\\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be high, we have grown our technical workforce and have been successful in attracting top talent to\\nNVIDIA.

Some of\\nour customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to replace those\\nwe are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish\\nmarket share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand\\nfor our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to estimate customer demand accurately,\\nhas led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting\\nthe semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously\\nexperienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums,\\nprovided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our product costs and this may continue.\\nWe may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs.\\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be able to reduce our supply\\ncommitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and demand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both\\nproduct shortages and excess inventory, significantly harmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and\\ncontract manufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to meet increased customer demand in a timely\\nmanner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we could lose revenue and market share. Additionally, since some of our\\nproducts are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a\\nbroader revenue impact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are\\nnot available from third parties.\\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to utilize on-hand inventory\\nor reduce purchase commitments accordingly. We have had to reduce average selling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for\\ncertain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, write down our inventory, incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may\\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders placed in advance of our historical\\nlead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to\\nincrease as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of\\nthese factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,\\ninclude:\\n•\\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\\n•\\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\\n•\\nchanges in business and economic conditions;\\n•\\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\\n•\\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\\n•\\nthe availability of sufficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;\\n•\\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\\n•\\nnew or unexpected end-use cases;\\n•\\nincrease in demand for competitive products;\\n•\\nchanges in end-user demand;\\n16'),\n",

In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan\\nand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to\\nour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our\\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both\\ncurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more\\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component\\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\\nnew products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\\nproducts. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of\\nAI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\\neach year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. Qualification\\ntime for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product\\nintroductions can reduce, or create volatility in, our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation\\narchitectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future\\narchitecture transitions. Our financial results have been and may in the future be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as\\nplanned for any reason. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that\\ncould increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarter\\nof fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\\nWe incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products\\nor adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be\\nable to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product\\ntransitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our\\nsupply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able\\nto generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any\\nreasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.\\nThe use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future demand for our products, including by leading to\\ninconsistent spikes and drops in demand.

We may have limited insight into the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers,\\nincluding for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information\\nsecurity measures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the past and may happen in the\\nfuture), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their systems, logs and other information related to the security\\nincident.

Climate change, its impact\\non our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our\\nvendors do business, may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. Although we\\nmaintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and\\ncost.

As our system design becomes increasingly complex, system integrators may be unable to meet specifications of\\nour key customers. Changes in our partners' or customers' business models or their ownership can reduce the number of partners available to us and harm our\\nability to sell our advanced data center systems to customers. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our\\nproducts into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our\\ncustomers can generally cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may\\ndevelop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the\\nmarkets for which they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Many of our indirect customers often do not\\npurchase directly from us but through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect\\ncustomer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% or\\nmore of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.

Changes in immigration and work permit regulations, or in their\\nadministration or interpretation, could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for talent drives up costs in the form of cash and\\nstock-based compensation. In times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our\\nstock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team.

The efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our\\ngrowth. We continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system\\nimplementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfully\\noperate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results.

Our vendors have\\nrequested and may continue to ask for shorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have\\navailable for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our revenue growth, creating\\nvolatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is\\nlikely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has in the past, or substantial price volatility.\\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the export of our products, which may\\nadversely impact our business.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement;\\ntaxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls\\nand cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product\\nregulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws.\\nCompliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations\\nand ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate\\napplicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines,\\ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws,\\nrules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs,\\nand/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance\\ncosts as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity\\nvulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European\\nUnion, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding\\nour business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have\\nalso received, and continue to receive, broad requests for information from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United\\nKingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our\\ninvestments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our\\nstrategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and\\npartners. We expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests may be expensive and burdensome and could negatively impact\\nour business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.\\nGovernments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, software, and systems used to develop\\nfrontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became effective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year\\ntransitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have already\\nenacted regulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase our compliance costs.\\nRestrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of\\nnew systems using our products, and reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to\\nlaws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import duties\\nor tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the\\ntiming of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively\\nimpact our business and results of operations.\\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or\\nexport regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on\\n25\"),\n",

These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop,\\nproduce and manufacture certain chips to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits,\\nDGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated\\ncircuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are\\nalso now licensing requirements to export a wide array of products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in\\nChina. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing\\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent\\nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China.\\nOn October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S\\nproducts (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to\\nthese requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. To\\ndate, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified,\\nimpose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or\\ncorresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs,\\n(including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include\\nfuture NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance\\nand/or performance density.\\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet\\nthe characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier 2” status. The AI Diffusion IFR would confer special benefits on\\nselect “Universal Verified End Users”, or UVEU, and lesser benefits on “National Verified End Users”, or NVEU. The AI Diffusion IFR would have numerous\\neffects that may negatively impact our long-term financial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by expressly limiting exports, reexports,\\nand transfers of covered products to Tier 2 countries and companies in Tier 1 countries that are either headquartered in Tier 2, or have an ultimate parent\\nheadquartered in a Tier 2 country. These restrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a select number of government-approved firms\\nthat achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own accelerators, platforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG regulations, including foreign competition.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers’ costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges and risks, and impact our supply and\\ndistribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and related extraterritorial regulatory obligations.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from other countries, in the form of tariffs, import/export\\ncontrols, or other regulatory actions.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR’s licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a timely manner, support existing customers using\\ncovered products, or supply customers with covered products outside the impacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one or\\nmore of the identified countries.\\n27'),\n",

Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution\\noperations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for\\nwhich the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing\\nrequirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the licensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a\\nlicense or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is approved, it may impose burdensome conditions that\\nwe or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG evaluates license requests in a closed process that does not have clear standards or\\nan opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers\\nin China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions that are onerous, even for small-\\nsized systems that are not able to train frontier AI models. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and\\nmay in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire\\nlicenses for their products.\\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long\\nterm, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if\\ncustomers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other\\nextended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition\\ncosts. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users\\ncannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale\\ntechnical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor\\nsuppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time\\nand further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the\\nevent of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing\\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries\\ndesignated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a\\nservice large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose\\nadditional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if certain events, including unauthorized\\nsystem configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands\\nsuch controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such\\nproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs increases over time, export controls may\\nhave a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those controls. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a\\nsubstantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may\\nalso negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking\\nproducts, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control\\nthat impacts a wider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors\\nthat sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside\\nChina and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that\\nthey are able to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage overseas\\ngovernments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and\\nfinancial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in\\nother markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced\\nsemiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the\\nsame time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. If additional products are\\nsubject to worldwide licensing requirements, we may incur significant inventory provisions and excess purchase obligation charges.\\nIn addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in\\nwhole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if\\nadopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\\n28'),\n",

If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions\\nthat have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of publicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or\\nother social, economic or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible development and\\nuse of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Leveraging\\nAI capabilities to potentially improve our internal functions and operations may present further risks, costs, and challenges. Complying with multiple regulations\\nfrom different jurisdictions related to AI may further increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, and may\\nimpede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with existing and\\nproposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the European Union, may further increase the cost of related research and development,\\nand create additional reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the European Union Code of Practice for\\nGeneral Purpose Artificial Intelligence could require us to notify the European Commission regarding details of some of our Trustworthy AI processes related to\\nour risk framework. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business\\npractices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of AI by\\nus or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.\\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful\\nor if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights violations by us, our employees or parties\\nthat we have agreed to indemnify.

We could be subject to countersuits as a result. If\\ninfringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the\\nthird party’s IP rights. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities\\nor have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross\\nlicense our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore,\\nthe indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.\\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in\\nwhich we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of\\npiracy of our technology and products more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information could harm\\nour competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development and\\nmarketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek\\nformal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if\\napproved, whether they will be enforceable.\\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. These areas could damage our\\nreputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and\\ninternal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate\\nuse of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters,\\nincluding for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in\\nour possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased\\nsecurity or remediation costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal\\ndata privacy and consumer protection. Numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses,\\nincluding providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights\\nmay include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising,\\nprofiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states\\nalso impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments.\\nThese state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy\\nRights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal\\ninformation, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for substantial fines for intentional violation and the law\\ncreated a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels.\\nAdditionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of AI and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to\\nadditional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted\\nthe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of\\npersons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose\\ndata is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or\\n4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act and similar legislation could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us\\nand require us to change our business practices. Additionally, Europe’s Network and Information Security Directive, or NIS2, regulates resilience and incident\\nresponse capabilities of entities operating in a number of sectors, including the digital infrastructure sector. Non-compliance with NIS2 may lead to administrative\\nfines of a maximum of 10 million Euros or up to 2% of the total worldwide revenue of the preceding fiscal year.\\nIn the ordinary course of business, we transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain\\njurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data\\n30'),\n",

For example, the GDPR governs the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of\\n“Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found\\nto provide an adequate level of protection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well as the\\nEU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance\\nand participate in the Framework) are mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these\\nmechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the\\nUnited States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any\\nof which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China’s law imposes various\\nrequirements relating to data processing and data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China’s law, including personal data, may not be\\ntransferable outside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements,\\nincluding CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or\\nimpact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our\\nbusiness operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to\\nincrease our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies\\nfrom transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our\\nbusiness.\\nWe are also bound by certain contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful\\nor may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific\\ncontractual restrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that\\npersonal data, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials\\nand other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. Regulators in the U.S. are\\nincreasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or\\nmisrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is\\ninconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and\\npractices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with\\nsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant\\nconsequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing\\npersonal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial\\ncondition.\\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expected\\ntax rates and other tax-related factors.\\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in\\ndetermining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although\\nwe believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes\\nimposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause other\\nadverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the U.S., with\\na significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced,\\nour provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income, and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax\\nrate in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could increase as a result of international tax developments, including the implementation of the Two-Pillar\\nframework led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, which involves the reallocation of taxing rights in respect of certain\\nmultinational enterprises above a fixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business (referred to as Pillar One), and imposes a minimum\\neffective corporate tax rate (referred to as Pillar Two). A number of countries in which we conduct business have enacted, or are in the process of enacting,\\nelements of the Pillar Two rules. Any such tax laws, or changes in any such tax laws may increase tax uncertainty and compliance costs and adversely affect our\\nprovision for income taxes, cash tax payments, results of operations, and financial condition.\\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries\\nwith differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions,\\n31'),\n",

Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\xa0\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” our\\nConsolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock.\\xa0\\nOverview\\nOur Company and Our Businesses\\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the\\ngaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin\\napplications.\\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,\\nItem 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\nDemand and Supply\\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions. Demand for our\\nHopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of\\nfiscal year 2025.\\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to\\ngenerate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and\\nscale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems.\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our\\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both\\ncurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more\\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component\\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nProduct Transitions and New Product Introductions\\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\\nnew products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\\nproducts. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of\\nAI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\\neach year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The increased\\nfrequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other\\ncosts or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact\\nour ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the\\nfrequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.\\nWhile we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\\nability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\\nGlobal Trade\\nIn August 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia\\nof our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\n36'),\n",

The licensing\\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent\\nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for\\nshipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL\\n72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and\\nCountry Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand\\nthat partners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\\nWe expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before\\neach shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China grew in\\nfiscal year 2025. As a percentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels seen prior to the onset of export controls in October 2023. The\\nmarket in China for datacenter solutions remains competitive. We will continue to comply with export controls while serving our customers. To the extent that a\\ncustomer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such\\na license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified,\\nimpose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or\\ncorresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs,\\n(including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include\\nfuture NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance\\nand/or performance density.\\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet\\nthe characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long\\nterm, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has\\nchanged and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing\\nrequirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and\\nmay be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as\\nother impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose\\nrestrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our\\nability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive customers.\\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region, new and existing export\\ncontrols or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors\\n– Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\\nMacroeconomic Factors\\nMacroeconomic factors, including\\u202finflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, tariffs, and global economic and\\ngeopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and\\nquantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our\\ninvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously\\nmanage product availability and costs with our vendors.\\n37'),\n",

Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party\\nmanufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for\\nsome products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and\\nprovide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors,\\nnew product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and\\njudgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,\\nin part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we\\noperate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax\\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements\\naccordingly.\\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized based on all available evidence.\\nTo the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the\\nperiod.\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue Allowances\\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking\\ndistributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow\\nreturns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or MDFs, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs\\nbased on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for\\nspecific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program\\naccruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\\nLicense and Development Arrangements\\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting\\nperiod, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.\\nEstimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\\n39\"),\n",

Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a\\nsignificant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct\\nand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple performance obligations on a relative standalone\\nselling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in\\ncomparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service\\nseparately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\\nResults of Operations\\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 is presented below.

The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our\\noverall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and growth of our businesses.\\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of\\nplus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for these investments of $238 million.\\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, we had $8.5 billion of senior Notes outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to\\nNote 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part\\xa0IV, Item\\xa015 of this Annual Report on Form\\xa010-K for additional information.\\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as substantially all of our sales are in United States dollars and foreign\\ncurrency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange rates.\\xa0Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included\\nin other income or expenses. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2025\\nand 2024.\\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate\\nfluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively\\nimpact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their\\nmanufacturing costs.\\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January\\xa026, 2025 and January\\xa028, 2024, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\\nrelated to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been $136 million and $116 million lower, respectively.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we\\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January\\xa026, 2025 based on the criteria set forth in Internal\\nControl - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the\\ncriteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\\nJanuary\\xa026, 2025.\\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January\\xa026, 2025 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January\\xa026, 2025 that have materially affected, or are\\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our ERP system, which will update\\nmuch of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The\\nupgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial\\nreporting.\\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal\\ncontrols, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits\\nof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\\n46'),\n",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025,\\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\nCommission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January\\n26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2025 in\\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\\nby the COSO.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial\\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n50\"),\n",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\\nAs described in Notes 1, 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory\\nfor excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of\\nproducts, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market\\nconditions. As of January 26, 2025, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $10.1 billion and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory\\npurchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $30.8 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or\\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing\\nprovisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and\\nmarket conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions\\nrelated to future demand and market conditions.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess\\nproduct purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also\\nincluded, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\\ncommitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and\\nevaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equity\\nbalances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\\nFiscal Year\\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 were all 52-week years.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and\\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including\\nthose related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments,\\ninvestigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other\\ncharges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are\\nreasonable.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We\\ndetermine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in\\nthe contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is\\nallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance\\nobligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. Payment from customers, per our standard payment terms, is\\ngenerally due shortly after delivery of products, availability of software licenses or commencement of services.\\nProduct Sales Revenue\\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in\\nexchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support\\nand extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for\\nreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.

As a result, we recognize the\\nrevenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services\\nare performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each\\nproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\\nSoftware Licensing\\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either\\nperpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are\\nfrequently sold along with support, which includes the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades.\\nRevenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably\\nover the service period, or as services are performed.\\nCloud Services\\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided\\non a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the\\ncontract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but\\ncertain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance\\nobligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements\\nindicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple performance obligations on a relative standalone\\nselling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar\\ncircumstances and to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\\nProduct Warranties\\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware\\ncomponent failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a\\nloss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\nStock-based Compensation\\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,\\nor RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on our corporate financial performance targets. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of\\ngrant to estimate the fair value of PSUs that are based on our stock performance compared to market performance, or market-based PSUs. The compensation\\nexpense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation\\nexpense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model based on performance targets probable of achievement. We estimate the fair value of\\nshares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and\\nSeptember of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and\\nmarket-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical forfeitures.\\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and\\nother intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third\\nparties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-\\nparty claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments.

However, the actual\\nliability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs. If we determine that\\na loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.\\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars\\nat end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet\\namounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated\\nStatements of Income and to date have not been significant.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax\\njurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary\\ndifferences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available\\nevidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of\\ncomplex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome,\\nchanges in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we\\nrecognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be\\ndue. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to\\nrecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\\nAs of January\\xa026, 2025, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6\\xa0billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\\nmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent\\nrealization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\nNet Income Per Share\\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is\\ncomputed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any\\nanti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be\\ncash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased and publicly-held\\nequity securities. We classify these investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are\\nreported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’\\nequity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are\\ndetermined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the Other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are subject to impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost\\nbasis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than\\nnot we will be required or we intend to\\n59'),\n",

Marketable debt and equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices.\\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative\\ndepends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods\\nof change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as\\naccounting hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and\\nis subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges,\\nchanges in fair value are recognized in earnings.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts\\nreceivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and\\nincludes certain limits on our portfolio maturities. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for\\npotential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall\\nestimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\\nInventories\\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist\\nprimarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We\\ncharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for\\nexcess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a\\nnew cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in\\nexcess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method\\nbased on the estimated useful lives of the assets of two to seven years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and\\naccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases\\nare amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease\\nassets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our\\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing\\nrate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to\\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.

The income and market\\nvaluation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and\\ncomparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic\\nfactors and the future profitability of our business.\\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under\\ntechnology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a\\nmethod that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably\\ndetermined, using a straight-line amortization method.\\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and\\nused is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by\\nthe asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the\\namount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based\\non the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately\\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no\\nlonger be depreciated.\\nBusiness Combination\\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on\\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded\\nas goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently\\nuncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of\\nprojected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,\\ntherefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may\\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated\\nStatements of Income.\\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\\nNon-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately-held companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value. These investments are\\nmeasured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or\\nsimilar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation\\nrequires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are\\nrecognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted for under the measurement alternative\\nbased on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value\\nand record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\n61\"),\n",

Our RSUs, PSUs, and market-\\nbased PSUs are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the\\ndividend yield.\\nAdditionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our historical forfeitures.\\nEquity Incentive Program\\nWe grant RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions\\nof various companies, we have assumed certain stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and converted them into our RSUs.\\nAmended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan\\nIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, or as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan.\\nThe 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance\\nstock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive\\nstock options. We grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan. As of January\\xa026, 2025, up to 274 million shares of our common stock could\\nbe issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, and 1.4 billion shares were available for future grants.\\n63'),\n",

Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including\\nattorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once\\nthe appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims,\\npurportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and\\nviolations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel\\ninventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and\\nimprovements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.\\nThe putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et\\nal. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-MN) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-MN), were stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re\\nNVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 5, 2025, after the Supreme Court issued its judgment dismissing the Company’s petition for writ of\\ncertiorari as improvidently granted in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action, the district court extended the stay for 30 days while the parties\\ndiscuss next steps and ordered the parties to file a joint status report by March 7, 2025. The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain\\nofficers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and\\nviolations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel\\ninventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits\\nfrom the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\\nAnother putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No.\\n2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and\\ninsider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on\\nGPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of\\nunspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation\\naction.\\nAccounting for Loss Contingencies\\nAs of January\\xa026, 2025, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities,\\nwhile reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is\\nqualified in its entirety by express reference to, the applicable provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws, which are filed as\\nexhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, of which this Exhibit 4.6 is a part, and are incorporated by reference herein. We encourage you to\\nread our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) for more\\ninformation.\\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 80,000,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value, and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock,\\n$0.001 par value.\\nCommon Stock\\nThe holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. The\\nholders of common stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors, and as a consequence, minority\\nstockholders are not able to elect directors on the basis of their votes alone. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any shares of\\npreferred stock currently outstanding or issued in the future, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be\\ndeclared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our\\ncommon stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then\\noutstanding preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights and no right to convert their common stock into any other\\nsecurities. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.\\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Charter Documents\\nCertificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\\nStockholders have no cumulative voting rights.\\nOur certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly\\ncalled annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing and that the stockholders may amend our\\nbylaws or adopt new bylaws only by the affirmative vote of 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting securities in addition to any vote of the holders of\\nany class or series of stock of the corporation required by law or by our certificate of incorporation.\\nA special meeting of the stockholders may be called by:\\n•\\nour Chairman, if any;\\n•\\nour Chief Executive Officer;'),\n",

Since our board of directors has the power to retain and discharge our officers,\\nthese provisions could also make it more difficult for existing stockholders or another party to effect a change in management.\\nThese and other provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management. These provisions\\nare intended to enhance the likelihood of continued stability in the composition of our board of directors and in the policies of our board of\\ndirectors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change in control. These provisions are\\ndesigned to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that\\nmay be used in proxy fights.

In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Service\\nRecipient, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations or rights, if any, with regard to all Tax-Related\\nItems by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from your wages or any other cash compensation otherwise payable to you; (ii)\\ncausing you to tender a cash payment or requiring you to make a payment in another form acceptable to the Company; (iii) permitting or\\nrequiring you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (a\\n“FINRA Dealer”) (if required, pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) whereby you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the\\nshares to be delivered upon settlement of your Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the Tax-Related Items and whereby the FINRA Dealer\\nirrevocably commits to forward the proceeds necessary to satisfy the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items directly to the Company and/or\\nthe Service Recipient, including a commitment pursuant to a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1 plan; (iv) withholding shares of\\nCommon Stock from the shares of Common Stock issued or otherwise issuable to you upon settlement of the Award with a value equal to the\\namount of such withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items or such other amount as may be permitted while still avoiding classification of the\\nAward as a liability for financial accounting purposes; provided, however, that if you are an Officer, then the Company will withhold a number of\\nshares of Common Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such withholding method is not\\nfeasible under applicable law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, as determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in which\\ncase, any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (i)-(iii) above; and/or (v) any other\\nmethod of withholding determined by the Company, provided such method is compliant with applicable law and the Plan.\\n(c)\\nThe Company and/or the Service Recipient may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory or other withholding\\nrates, including maximum rates applicable in your jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld\\namount in cash from the Company or the Service Recipient (with no entitlement to the Common Stock equivalent), or if not refunded, you may\\nseek a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, you may be required to pay any Tax-Related Items directly to the\\napplicable tax authority or to the Company and/or the Service Recipient. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable rates in your country,\\nincluding your share of payroll or similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax authority’s administrative practices, not to exceed\\nthe highest rate in that jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax-\\nRelated Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the\\nfull number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa04.\\nEffective Date: January 23, 2025'),\n",

Information is material if it would influence a reasonable investor to trade or would significantly alter the total mix of\\npublicly available information. Information is non-public if it has not yet been broadly released to the public by way of a press release, conference call, public\\nfiling, or similar means of public dissemination.\\nWhile most NVIDIA employees work with company confidential information, only a small subset of non-public information rises to the level of MNPI. Examples of\\nmaterial information could include: financial results; significant mergers or acquisitions; major contracts; significant information regarding NVIDIA’s products and\\nservices; significant information about competition, customers, or market demand; major cybersecurity breaches, data protection or privacy incidents; key\\npersonnel changes; significant litigation; or material regulatory activity.\\nBLANKET PROHIBITIONS\\nFederal and state insider trading laws prohibit transacting in securities of any company when in possession of MNPI relevant to that company.\\nFederal and state laws also prohibit “tipping” or disclosing MNPI to third parties who then transact on that information—the tipper can be legally liable even if\\nthey do not benefit financially from any transaction.\\nThe following additional activities also are restricted at all times, regardless of whether you have MNPI or whether NVIDIA’s trading window (if applicable to you)\\nis open:\\n•\\nTrading in NVIDIA Derivatives.

The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers \\nthrough its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.

The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for \\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal \\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative \\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and \\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables \\nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have \\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings \\nwith large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products \\nand a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut \\nprices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products \\nat little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for \\nfree and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition \\nas competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated \\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain \\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with \\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the \\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s \\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, \\nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing \\nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of \\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, \\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of \\nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such \\nintellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such \\nownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, \\ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the \\nCompany has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single \\nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the \\nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include \\nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various \\naspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such \\nlicenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future \\non reasonable terms or at all.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3'),\n",

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect \\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an \\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and \\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nHuman Capital\\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best \\ntalent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its \\npeople can do the best work of their lives. As of September\\xa0 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time \\nequivalent employees.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the \\nCompany’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their \\nneeds and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide \\nvariety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.\\nGrowth and Development\\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs \\nthrough Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can \\nalso take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to \\nsupport their well-being.\\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of \\nharassment or discrimination.\\nInclusion and Diversity\\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities \\nit serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and \\nsupport equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\\nEngagement\\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an \\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to \\ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee \\nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\\nHealth and Safety\\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace \\nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security \\nand crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard \\nenvironments.

In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially \\nadversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset \\nvalues, and other economic factors.\\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global \\nor regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics \\nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial \\ninstability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the \\nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced \\nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments.

Substantially all of the Company’s \\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South \\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, \\ntechnology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly \\nsignificant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its \\nrevenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products \\nand the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including \\nchanging suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, \\nservices and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with \\nnew or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s \\noperations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company \\nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, \\nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company’s business. If disputes \\nand conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive \\nand could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract \\nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in \\ncertain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the \\nCompany’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear \\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity \\nattacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains \\ncan be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create \\ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s \\nservice offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While \\nthe Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur \\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. \\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the \\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; \\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight \\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales \\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays \\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.\\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant \\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.

Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the \\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if \\ncompetitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be \\nmaterially adversely affected.\\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces \\nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other \\nresources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the \\nCompany’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. \\nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins.

The Company has also outsourced \\nmuch of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the \\nCompany’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future \\nhave an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the \\nCompany’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for \\nproduct defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-\\nwarranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While \\nthe Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from \\ntime to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many \\ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s \\nhardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of \\ncomponents or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be \\ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial \\ndisputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, \\ngeopolitical tensions, or conflict.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, \\nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements \\nhelp ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial \\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of \\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and \\nuncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on \\ncommercially reasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant \\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to \\nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s \\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past \\nexperienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities \\nof components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the \\nCompany has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able \\nto extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial \\nconditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the \\nCompany’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the \\nCompany remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its \\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product \\nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing \\ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any \\nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components \\ncustomized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has \\nbeen delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the \\nCompany’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints \\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Component defects could make the Company’s \\nproducts unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the \\nCompany’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings \\ncan have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the \\nCompany’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations.

The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for \\norders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its \\nsuppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be \\nrecoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which \\nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory \\nprepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company \\nwill not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence \\nin the industries in which the Company competes.\\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. \\nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for \\nperiods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price \\nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components \\nor products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on \\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all.\\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires \\nlicenses from those third parties.

In addition, agreements \\nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and \\ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government \\ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, \\nhas generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and \\nnew claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and \\nother patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on \\nallegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending \\ninfringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these \\nactions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be \\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company \\nmay enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance \\nsuch agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly \\nincrease the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and \\nlimit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against \\nthe Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s \\nresults of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an \\noutcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or \\ninjunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change \\nits business practices and limit the Company’s ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and \\nservices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial \\ncondition.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to \\ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to \\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; \\nprivacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services \\nand technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and \\nartificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; \\navailability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; \\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and \\nenvironmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely \\naffect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or \\nfeature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for \\nthe Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or supply chain.

Although the Company \\nhas programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance \\nthat such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s \\nproducts could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s \\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose \\nthe Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s \\nbusiness.\\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on \\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas \\nemissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals \\nand initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other \\ncommunications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of the \\nCompany’s announced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-\\nparty performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its \\nannounced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the \\nCompany’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, \\nadhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and \\nregulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings \\nagainst the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial \\ncondition and stock price.\\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory \\nscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, \\ncompetition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes \\nin the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers \\nwithin apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the \\nDMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution \\nfor iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional \\ntools and APIs for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to \\nfeedback and engagement with the European Commission (the “Commission”). Although the Company’s compliance plan is \\nintended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private \\nlitigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the \\nCompany to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new \\nprivacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can \\nresult in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially \\nadverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject \\nto civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance \\nsmartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of \\ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are \\nresolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes \\nto its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations \\nand financial condition.\\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become \\nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the \\nCompany’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, \\nresults of operations and financial condition.

In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party \\ntransactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several \\njurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have \\nlaws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with \\nemerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future \\nrequire the Company to change its business practices.

Any failure by the Company to \\ncomply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could \\nresult in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, \\npenalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the \\nCompany is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health \\ndata, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach \\nnotification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance \\nwith these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial \\ndata is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, \\nthe Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, \\nand can also incur significant fees or fines.\\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder \\ninformation is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur \\nsignificant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also \\nexperience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow \\npayment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, \\nresults of operations and financial condition.\\nFinancial Risks\\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, \\nthe gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross \\nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global \\nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased \\ncompetition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product \\nlife cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, \\nacquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs \\neffectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that \\nregulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; \\ninflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or \\nservices with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of \\noperations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in \\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of \\nsales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a \\ndecline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to \\nunexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new \\nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the \\nCompany’s logistics, supply or manufacturing partners.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15'),\n",

In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to \\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross \\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign \\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its \\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may \\nincrease the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to \\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a \\nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are \\nin place.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and \\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of \\nthe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not \\nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in \\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments \\nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, \\nretailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and \\neducation, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not \\ncovered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the \\nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to \\ncredit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks \\nmay be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by \\noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In \\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory \\ncomponents. As of September\\xa028, 2024, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term \\nsupply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has \\nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term \\nprepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to \\nadditional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a \\nnumber of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized.

The Company \\nbelieves that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and \\nengagement with the Commission.\\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil \\nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or \\nattempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. \\nThe DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters \\nhave been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary \\ndamages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend \\nitself.\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District \\nCourt”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based \\nupon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App \\nStore Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from \\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than \\nApple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, \\n2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California \\nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the \\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with \\nthe California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to \\nvigorously defend itself.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the \\nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in \\nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is \\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above \\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially \\nadversely affected.\\nItem 4. \\nMine Safety Disclosures\\nNot applicable.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 18'),\n",

The program does \\nnot obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\\xa028, 2024, the Company’s quarterly cash \\ndividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the \\nBoard.\\nIn May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly dividend \\nfrom $0.24 to $0.25 per share beginning in May 2024. During 2024, the Company repurchased $95.0 billion of its common stock \\nand paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.2 billion.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIncome Taxes\\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. \\n2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which will require the Company \\nto disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling \\nitems that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid \\ndisclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The \\nCompany will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\\nSegment Reporting\\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment \\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly \\nprovided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to \\ndisclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment \\nperformance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a \\nretrospective transition method.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles \\n(“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s \\nmanagement to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the \\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. \\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under \\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s \\nuncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and \\ninternational tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although \\nmanagement believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these \\nuncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing \\nfacts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent \\nwith management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of \\nwhich are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount \\nis reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner \\ninconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating \\nresults.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 26'),\n",

The Company uses various strategies \\nto manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio \\nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase \\nthe interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative \\ninstruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any \\nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\\xa028, 2024 and \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2023 (dollars in millions):\\nInterest Rate\\nSensitive Instrument\\nHypothetical Interest\\nRate Increase\\nPotential Impact\\n2024\\n2023\\nInvestment portfolio\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nDecline in fair value\\n$ \\n2,755 \\n$ \\n3,089 \\nTerm debt\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nIncrease in annual interest expense\\n$ \\n139 \\n$ \\n194 \\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other \\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the \\nCompany’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair \\nvalues of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use \\nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company \\nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or \\nprohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of \\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair \\nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. \\nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 \\nmillion and $669 million as of September\\xa028, 2024 and September\\xa030, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying \\nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the \\nCompany’s foreign currency derivatives.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27'),\n",

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the \\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s \\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over \\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer \\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer \\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the \\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). \\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are \\nestablished that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they \\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers \\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation \\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, \\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac \\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the \\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive \\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any \\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable \\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue \\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which \\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized \\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For \\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that \\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized \\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the \\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when \\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, \\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party \\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the \\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services \\nnet sales only the commission it retains.\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\niPhone\\n$ \\n201,183 \\n$ \\n200,583 \\n$ \\n205,489 \\nMac\\n \\n29,984 \\n \\n29,357 \\n \\n40,177 \\niPad\\n \\n26,694 \\n \\n28,300 \\n \\n29,292 \\nWearables, Home and Accessories\\n \\n37,005 \\n \\n39,845 \\n \\n41,241 \\nServices (1)\\n \\n96,169 \\n \\n85,200 \\n \\n78,129 \\nTotal net sales\\n$ \\n391,035 \\n$ \\n383,285 \\n$ \\n394,328 \\n(1)\\nServices net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa030, \\n2023, $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa024, 2022, and $7.5 \\nbillion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa025, 2021.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 35'),\n",

The Company also competes for various components with \\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many \\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide \\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by \\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new \\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have \\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to \\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in \\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the \\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe \\nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong \\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable \\nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is \\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market \\ndynamics of each geographic region.\\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for \\ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in \\nthose geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and \\noperating expenses directly attributable to the segment.

Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the \\nAward Date and the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial \\nportion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award.

The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is \\nreferred to as the “Participant.”  The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice \\nis referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the \\nApple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”).  Capitalized terms are \\ndefined in the Plan if not defined herein.  The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the \\nParticipant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be \\npaid to the Participant.  The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to as the “Award \\nAgreement” applicable to the Award.\\n2.\\nRSUs.  As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement \\nwhich is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes \\nof the Plan and this Award Agreement.  RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the determination of \\nthe Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award \\nAgreement.  The RSUs are an unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated \\nas property or as a trust fund of any kind.\\n3.\\nVesting.  Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become \\nnonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice.  (Each vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred \\nto herein as a “Vesting Date.”)  Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional Shares in \\nsettlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and \\nvest when such combined fractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried \\nforward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next subsequent Vesting Date shall be \\nforfeited.\\n4.\\nContinuance of Employment.  Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 \\nbelow, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through each applicable \\nVesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and the rights and \\nbenefits under this Award Agreement.  Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the \\nAward Date and the first Vesting Date, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any \\nproportionate vesting of the Award.  For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include \\n(a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the \\nfirst thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the \\nCompany, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) \\nday of a personal leave of absence.\\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service \\ncommitment by the Company, affects the Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to \\ntermination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain employed by or in \\nservice to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any \\nSubsidiary at any time to terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or \\nany Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other compensation or benefits. Nothing in this \\nSection 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant \\nwithout the Participant’s consent thereto.\\n1'),\n",

The recipient of the Award identified in the \\nGrant Notice is referred to as the “Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the \\nGrant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted under and is subject to the \\nprovisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”). \\nCapitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been \\ngranted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise \\npayable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms (including Exhibit A hereto, \\nincorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the “Award Agreement” applicable to \\nthe Award.\\n2.\\nRSUs.  As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement \\nwhich is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes \\nof the Plan and this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the determination \\nof the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award \\nAgreement. The RSUs are an unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated \\nas property or as a trust fund of any kind.\\n3.\\nVesting.

Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 \\nbelow, vesting of the Award requires continued active employment or service through the Vesting Date as \\na condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. \\nEmployment or service for only a portion of the performance or vesting period, even if a substantial \\nportion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this \\nAward Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other \\nthan a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of \\nabsence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion.

Introduction\\nThis Rule 10D-1 Recovery Policy (the “Policy”) is administered by the People and \\nCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. (the “Committee”), and \\ncovers Incentive-Based Compensation granted, awarded or paid by Apple Inc. or any of \\nits subsidiaries (“Apple”) to any employee who is an “executive officer” of Apple (each a \\n“Covered Executive”) as defined under Section 10D-1 of the Securities and Exchange \\nAct\\xa0 of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). The Policy is intended to comply with, and as applicable \\nto be administered and interpreted consistent with, and subject to the exceptions set \\nforth in, Listing Rule 5608 adopted by the Nasdaq Stock Market to implement Rule \\n10D-1 under the Exchange Act (collectively referred to herein as “Rule 10D-1”). For \\navoidance of doubt the Policy only applies to Covered Executives who served as a \\nCovered Executive for Apple at any point during the performance period for any \\nIncentive-Based Compensation that is Received on or after October 2, 2023. The Policy \\nexplains when Apple will be required to seek recovery of erroneously awarded \\nIncentive-Based Compensation from a Covered Executive.  \\nB. Incentive-Based Compensation\\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation \\ngranted, earned or vested based in whole or in part upon the attainment of one or more \\nfinancial reporting measures, that was Received (i) on or after October 2, 2023 and (ii) \\nby a person who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance \\nperiod for the Incentive-Based Compensation. Financial reporting measures are (i) any \\nmeasure(s) that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting \\nprinciples used in Apple’s financial statements and any measure(s) derived in whole or \\nin part from such measure(s) and (ii) any measure(s) that are based in whole or in part \\non Apple’s stock price or total shareholder return. For avoidance of doubt, Incentive-\\nBased Compensation includes awards granted to a Covered Executive that are \\noutstanding and unvested as of October 2, 2023. Incentive-Based Compensation is \\n“Received” in the fiscal period that the relevant financial reporting measure is attained \\nregardless of when it is paid or awarded.\\nFor avoidance of doubt, incentive-based compensation that is not earned or vested \\nbased on the attainment of one or more financial measures, including but not limited to \\ntime-based restricted stock units, is not covered compensation under this Policy but \\nmay be recouped under the Apple Inc. Executive Team Compensation Recoupment \\nPolicy. \\nExhibit 97.1'),\n",

Administration\\nThe Committee is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other \\ncommittees of the Board as may be necessary or appropriate for the administration of \\nthis Policy and engage third parties as it deems necessary to evaluate erroneously \\nawarded Incentive-Based Compensation Received. If the Committee determines \\nIncentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded and recovery is required \\npursuant to this Policy, Apple shall make any required disclosures for any affected \\nCovered Executives in its annual proxy statement. Apple will maintain and will provide to \\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market documentation of all determinations and actions taken in \\ncomplying with the Policy.  Any determinations made by the Committee under this \\nPolicy shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.  \\nD. Section 10D-1 Recovery \\nPursuant to Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make reasonable efforts to recover any \\nIncentive-Based Compensation Received by any Covered Executive during the three \\ncompleted fiscal years immediately preceding the date that Apple is required to prepare \\nan Accounting Restatement under Rule 10D-1 and any transition period of less than \\nnine months that is within or immediately following such three years if the Committee \\ndetermines the Incentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded. An \\n“Accounting Restatement” is a correction to Apple’s financial statements that, due to \\nApple’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. \\nfederal securities laws, is (1) is material to a prior financial reporting period or (2) would \\nbe material to the current financial reporting period if corrected in the current period or \\nleft uncorrected in the current period.  \\nRecovery will be limited to the amount of the gross, pre-tax, Incentive-Based \\nCompensation that was erroneously Received because it exceeded the amount that \\nwould have been Received had it been determined based on any restated financial \\nmeasures in the Accounting Restatement. If the Incentive-Based Compensation is \\nbased on stock price or total shareholder return, the Committee shall determine a \\nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement, if any, on the stock \\nprice or total shareholder return and based on that reasonable estimate, whether \\nIncentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded. \\nIf the erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation cannot be recovered \\nbecause recovery efforts are excessively burdensome, the recovery value exceeds the \\ncost of recovery to Apple or recovery would be contrary to laws outside the United \\nStates, each as determined in accordance with Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make a \\ndetermination whether further recovery efforts would be in shareholders’ best interests \\nand should continue or would otherwise be excusable under Rule 10D-1.\\n2'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful'),\n",
